# hello-world

Stepping into banking industry for over 3 years, I have moved from a middle office to a front office, but finally here I am, trying to refresh my coding skills for a next career break through. Having experiencing strugles and painfulness in banking, a part of me always know that I want to be in a developing / coding related world, trying to make changes with the help of a more efficient and collaborative environment.

I said I would like to learn more about Python and C++ the last time I use github, I guess that'll be my start. 3 years into working in the financial industry, python seems to be the future.
